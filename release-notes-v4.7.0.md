# Linux Distro Agent v4.7.0 Release Notes

## 🎉 Major New Feature: Interactive Configuration Wizard

We're excited to announce the release of Linux Distro Agent v4.7.0, featuring the highly requested **Interactive Configuration Wizard** that makes creating custom Linux distributions easier than ever!

## ✨ What's New

### 🧙‍♂️ Interactive Configuration Wizard (`config-wizard`)
- **Complete Interactive Setup**: Step-by-step guided configuration for building custom Linux distributions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Configure all aspects of your distribution including:
  - Basic distribution information (name, version, description, architecture)
  - Base system selection (Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, openSUSE, Alpine, or from scratch)
  - Package management (essential packages, desktop environments, additional software)
  - Kernel configuration (Vanilla, LTS, Hardened, Real-time, or custom)
  - Bootloader setup (GRUB, systemd-boot, rEFInd, Syslinux)
  - Custom branding (logos, wallpapers, color schemes, themes)
  - Filesystem options (SquashFS/ext4/btrfs/xfs with compression)
  - Build optimization settings
  - User account configuration
  - Validation and security settings

### 🚀 Enhanced User Experience
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible default values for all configuration options
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- **Configuration Summary**: Review your settings before finalizing
- **TOML Output**: Generates configuration files compatible with `build-distro`
- **Flexible Output**: Specify custom output paths or use auto-generated filenames

## 📋 Usage Examples

```bash
# Interactive wizard with full experience
lda config-wizard

# Specify custom output file
lda config-wizard -o my-custom-distro.toml

# Skip confirmation prompts (automated mode)
lda config-wizard -y

# Use generated config to build your distribution
lda build-distro -c my-custom-distro.toml
```

## 🔧 Perfect Workflow Integration

The new wizard integrates seamlessly into the Linux Distro Agent workflow:

1. **Configure** → `lda config-wizard` (creates your distribution configuration)
2. **Build** → `lda build-distro -c config.toml` (builds the ISO image)
3. **Deploy** → Test with qemu or burn to USB/DVD

## 🏗️ Technical Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and recovery options
- **Optimized Performance**: Improved build performance with better resource utilization
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint during configuration generation
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works consistently across all supported Linux distributions

## 🎯 Supported Features

### Desktop Environments
- GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, LXDE, MATE, Cinnamon
- Tiling window managers: i3, Sway
- Headless/server configurations
- Custom desktop environment support

### Base Systems
- **Arch Linux** (primary support)
- **Debian/Ubuntu** (stable and testing)
- **Fedora/CentOS** (latest versions)
- **openSUSE** (Leap and Tumbleweed)
- **Alpine Linux** (lightweight builds)
- **From Scratch** (advanced users)

### Build Optimizations
- Parallel package installation
- Package caching for faster rebuilds
- ccache integration for compilation speed
- Configurable compression algorithms (gzip, xz, zstd, lz4)
- Multi-core utilization
